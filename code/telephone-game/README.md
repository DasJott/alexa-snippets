The Telephone Game (Chinese Whispers or Stille Post) demonstrates an alternative approach for kind of free speech input similar to the slot type [AMAZON.LITERAL](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/custom-interaction-model-reference.html#literal) only available for English (US). The idea is based on the blogpost ["Why a Custom Slot is the Literal Solution"](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/post/Tx3IHSFQSUF3RQP/why-a-custom-slot-is-the-literal-solution) which simple explains, that each custom slot can be used to collect an arbitrary word or phrase from what the user said - if you spend some effort to trick the Machine Learning behind (see the [InteractionModel](./speech-assets) and you might get the idea). Please note, that does not turn Alexa into a transcription tool for speech to text!
